         <h1>Our Tale</h1>
            <p>It all started when my sister had an idea to introduce us to each other. We were half way across the world - Kiran in Seattle and myself in Kerala, India - but we still thought to give it a shot. We liked each other from the very first text message! But obviously we had to figure out if this was the right thing to do so we kept exploring each other. It just kept getting better everyday.</p>
            <p>A month after we started talking , Kiran visited me. We got to spend a good amount of time together and we knew that this was it. </p>
            <p>Our parents knew what was happening and they decided on the wedding date. Yes! It was an arranged-love #! </p>
